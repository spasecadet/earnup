## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`
Runs `yarn start` and `firebase serve` but requires that you be logged into my firebase account to run locally.

## `Notes`
I wouldn't consider this production ready - there isn't really any error handling - though to be fair I haven't really come across a lot of errors.  I haven't sanitized any of the text either - I don't think I need to, but I haven't tested extensively.  It's just being stored as a string though and displayed as a string so there shouldn't be any danger.
